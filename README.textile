h1. Mailboxer "!https://secure.travis-ci.org/ging/mailboxer.png!":http://travis-ci.org/ging/mailboxer

This project is based on the need of a private message system for "ging / social_stream":https://github.com/ging/social_stream. 
Instead of creating our core message system heavily dependent on our development we are trying to implement a generic and potent 
messaging gem.

After looking for a good gem to use we notice the lack of messaging gems and functionality in them. Mailboxer tries to fill this
emptiness giving a powerfull and generic message system. It supports the use of conversations with two or more recipients, 
send notification to a recipient (intended to be used as system notifications "Your picture has new comments", "John Doe has
updated its document", etc.), emails the messageable model (if configured to do so). It has a complete use of a @Mailbox@ object
for each messageable with @inbox@, @sentbox@ and @trash@. 

The gem is constantly growing and improving its functionality. As it is used with our paralell development "(ging / social_stream)":https://github.com/ging/social_stream
we are finding and fixing bugs continously. If you want some functionality not supported yet or marked as TODO, you can create 
an "issue":https://github.com/ging/mailboxer/issues to ask for it. It will be a great feedback for us, and we will know what you
may find useful of the gem.

Mailboxer was born from the great, but outdated, code from "lpsergi / acts_as_messageable":https://github.com/psergi/acts_as_messageable.

We are now working to make an exhaustive documentation and some wiki pages in order to make even easier to use the gem at its 
full potencial. Please, give us some time if you find something missing or "ask for it":https://github.com/ging/mailboxer/issues.

h2. Installation

Add to your Gemfile:
<pre><code>
  gem 'mailboxer'
</code></pre>
Then run:
<pre><code>
  bundle update
</code></pre>
Run install script:
<pre><code>
  rails g mailboxer:install
</code></pre>
And don't forget to migrate you database:
<pre><code>
  rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

h2. Requirements

We are now adding support for sending emails when a Notification or a Message is sent to one o more recipients. So that, we must assure that Messageable models have some specific methods. These methods are:
<pre><code>
  #Returning any kind of identification you want for the model
  def name
    return "You should add method :name in your Messageable model"
  end
  #Returning the email address of the model
  def email
    return "define_email@on_your.model"
  end
  #Returning whether an email should be sent for this object (Message or Notification)
  def should_email?(object)
    return true
  end
</code></pre>
These names are explicit enough to avoid colliding with other methods, but as long as you need to change them you can do it by using mailboxer initializer. Just add or uncomment the following lines:
<pre><code>
  #Configures the methods needed by mailboxer
  config.email_method = :email
  config.name_method = :name
  config.should_email_method = :should_email?
</code></pre>
You may change whatever you want or need. For example:
<pre><code>
  config.email_method = :notifications_email
  config.name_method = :display_name
  config.should_email_method = :do_you_want_this_to_be_mailed?
</code></pre>
Will use the method @notification_email@ instead of @email@, @display_name@ for @name@ and @do_you_want_this_to_be_mailed?@ for @should_email?@ 

Using default or custom method names, if your model doesn't implement them, Mailboxer will use dummy methods not to crash but notify you the missing methods.

h2. Preparing your models

In your model:
<pre><code>
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base      
    acts_as_messageable
  end
</code></pre>
You are not limited to User model. You can use Mailboxer in any other model and use it in serveral different models. If you have ducks and cylons in your application and you want to interchange messages as if they where the same, just use act_as_messageable in each one and you will be able to send duck-duck, duck-cylon, cylon-duck and cylon-cylon messages. Of course, you can extend it for as many clases as you need. Example:
<pre><code>
  class Duck < ActiveRecord::Base      
    acts_as_messageable
  end
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
  class Cylon < ActiveRecord::Base      
    acts_as_messageable
  end
</code></pre>

h2. Using Mailboxer. API

In order to mantain the README in a proper size and simplicity, all the API is available in "Mailboxer wiki":https://github.com/ging/mailboxer/wiki
